# EDA and A/B testing project

 This repository showcases two diverse projects, each providing valuable insights into different aspects of data analysis. 
 Whether you are interested in exploratory data analysis (EDA) or A/B testing, you'll find detailed Jupyter Notebooks and datasets to explore.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
## Project Overview

In the EDA project, we delve into the client database of a real estate company.
This comprehensive analysis includes data cleaning, reprocessing, and visualization
to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

### Explore the EDA Project
- **Folder:** `EDA`
  - [EDA_Project.ipynb](EDA/target_customers.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook with detailed code and visualizations.
  - [clients.csv](EDA/clients.csv): Dataset used for analysis.

### How to Engage
1. Open `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to perform a deep dive into the real estate client data.

## 2. A/B Testing Project

### Project Overview
The A/B testing project focuses on comparing two different versions (variants) to evaluate their impact on a specific metric, specifically conversion rates. Statistical testing is employed to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Explore the A/B Testing Project
- **Folder:** `ab_test_inference`
  - [AB_Test_Project.ipynb](ab_test_inference/ab_test_inference.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook with code and detailed analysis.
  - [ab_test_ensembles.csv](ab_test_inference/ab_test_ensembles.csv): Dataset used for A/B testing.

### How to Engage
1. Open `ab_test_inference.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the code cells sequentially to conduct A/B testing and interpret the results.

## Additional Resources
**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the Jupyter Notebooks. Use the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
```
